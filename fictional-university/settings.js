// If you're using Local by Flywheel you will
// want your settings to be similar to the examples below:

// exports.themeLocation = './public/wp-content/themes/fictional-university-theme/';
// exports.urlToPreview = 'http://fictional-university.local/';

// Simply remove the two slashes at the front of those lines
// to uncomment them and then delete lines #1 and #2.

// Be SURE to update urlToPreview to YOUR domain and not mine.
// Be SURE to update themeLocation to YOUR theme folder name
